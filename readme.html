<p>This is the readme about the super fun Even More Spourious Correlation! web app.</p>
<h2>Intro & Motivation</h2>

<p>Data: it's everywhere!</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be nice to have some application where I can see real data analysis?<br>
And some graphics?<br>
All this polls and data analysis hidden from the reader is a bad thing.</p>

<p>We would like you to have access to the important numbers that define if a data analysis is really successful.</p>

<h2>How to use:</h2>
<p>Super easy! Just choose any set of data you want to infer information onto by selecting them on the select boxes on your right. </p>
<p>The system won't allow you to infer information on the same set of data.</p>
<p>Click the "Entretain me!" button when you're ready, and read the results!</p>
