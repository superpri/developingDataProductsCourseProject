Even more spurious correlation!
===================================

Final Project on Developing Data Producs on the Data Science Specialization on Cousera given by Johns Hopkins University

1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
3. Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below
4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

The application must include the following:

1. Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
2. Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
3. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
4. You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
5.The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.

The Shiny application in question is entirely up to you. However, if you're having trouble coming up with ideas, you could start from the simple prediction algorithm done in class and build a new algorithm on one of the R datasets packages. Please make the package simple for the end user, so that they don't need a lot of your prerequisite knowledge to evaluate your application. You should emphasize a simple project given the short time frame.  

I chose to build a silly application inspired by [Spurious Correlation](http://tylervigen.com/) to show how any data could be related with a simple regression model, and with the help of bad interpreted numbers it can really become true. All the 5 vectors of data were taken from the Spurious Correlation site.

Intro & Motivation
===

Data: it's everywhere!

Wouldn't it be nice to have some application where I can see real data analysis?
And some graphics?
All this polls and data analysis hidden from the reader is a bad thing.

We would like you to have access to the important numbers that define if a data analysis is really successful.

How to use:
====

Super easy! 

Just choose any set of data you want to infer information onto by selecting them on the select boxes on your right.

The system won't allow you to infer information on the same set of data.

Click the "Entretain me!" button when you're ready, and read the results!
